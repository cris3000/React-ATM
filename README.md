Welcome to a ReactJS ATM App.

The App is a simple representation of an ATM, and it allows a user to view their balance, withdraw said balance, and go into their overdraft. Only one pincode is accepted "1111".



Steps to use the app:

Make sure a relatively recent NodeJS is installed.

1. Clone or Download the files.
2. In the root folder run 'npm Install'
3. Run 'npm install react-pin-input --save'
4. Run 'npm install react-router-dom'
5. Run 'npm start' to begin
